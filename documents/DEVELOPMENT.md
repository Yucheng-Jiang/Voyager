# DEVELOPMENT 



### Week 1 (Nov 17 - Nov 23)

- finish defining project structure (define header file, data structure, and write Makefile)

- Download dataset and perform data cleaning

- Parse dataset into project dataset and write corresponding testcases

- Write simple test cases for betweenness centrality

- implement betweenness draft, it's working but performance need improve

- Try drawing heat map based on centrality value, need to improve performance

  

### Week 2 (Nov 24 - Nov 30)

- Largely improve betweenness centrality algorithm based on [Brandes algorithm](https://web.archive.org/web/20171013152036/http://algo.uni-konstanz.de/publications/b-fabc-01.pdf)
- Add additional test cases for betweenness centrality
- Largely improve image drawing efficiency
- update Readme file


### week 3 (Dec 1 -  Dec 8)
- Add gif animation output functionality
- Add unit tests for centrality calculation and png output
- Write additional comments and documentation for functions
- Try to fix git commit history clean-up
